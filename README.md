# Pokemon In Nygårdsparken

## Description
A from-scracth project completed as a part of my Object-Oriented-Programming class at The University of Bergen(class id: INF101). The project is a 2D Pokemon inspired game drawing out a rough map of Nygårdsparken and Realfagsbygget in Bergen. A simple fight is simulated once interaction, by stepping over, the NPC placed in the fountain - result displayed on screen.

## Roadmap for Future Improvements
- [ ] Expanding the map in size.
- [ ] Upgrading tiles for more sophisticated design.
- [ ] Significantly improving the fight simulation - The goal being: Have the fight in a separate environment, like in the OG pokemon games.
- [ ] Add additional NPC's to the map.
- [ ] Improve modularity of code in order to have a "skeleton"/template for future 2D tile projects
